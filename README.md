## Hi there 👋

I'm Amartya Basu, currently a PhD student at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, NY, USA. My research interest is in the field of sensing, mobile systems and embedded AI.

Prior moving to the US, I completed my MS by Research in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Madras, Chenna, India. I received a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Government College of Engineering and Leather Technoloy, Kolkata, India.

🌱 I’m currently learning stuffs related to LLMs and Agentic AI, especially its application on low end devices.
